## START()
Lets say you have a dotnet solution containg more than one project. You need to pack these projects into a single
nuget file. 


```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ MySharedProject/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *.csproj
â”œâ”€â”€ MySharedProject.Data/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *.Data.csproj
â””â”€â”€ MySharedProject.sln
```

## HOW
```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <!-- Your Properties Here -->
	  <Name>LibraryProject</Name>
    <TargetsForTfmSpecificBuildOutput>
    $(TargetsForTfmSpecificBuildOutput);CopyProjectReferencesToPackage
    <TargetsForTfmSpecificBuildOutput>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <!-- Some other installed Nugets -->

  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="..\LibraryProject.Data\LibraryProject.Data.csproj" />
  </ItemGroup>
	
  <Target DependsOnTargets="ResolveReferences" Name="CopyProjectReferencesToPackage">
    <ItemGroup>
      <BuildOutputInPackage Include="@(ReferenceCopyLocalPaths->WithMetadataValue('ReferenceSourceTarget', 'ProjectReference'))"/>
    </ItemGroup>
  </Target>
</Project>
```

## Deep Dives ðŸŒŠ
What the !%#&@ is *[TargetsForTfmSpecificBuildOutput](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/msbuild-targets#targetsfortfmspecificbuildoutput)*???

<Quoteblock body={"Adds files (ie .dlls) from a path into the .nupkg file"} />

The Target & "BuildOutputInPackage" ensures that TargetsForTfmSpecificBuildOutput collects the correct
.dll file AND all of its own references! hate to be missing a third data package nested inside out lovely LibraryProject.Data.csproj


## Testing
A great way to see it works without directly importing it into another libary is to use 
[Nuget Package Explorer](https://github.com/NuGetPackageExplorer/NuGetPackageExplorer)

After packaging, open the .nupkg file using this tool to see whats contained the the bundle.
If everything is there then we have successfully made our lives simpler ðŸ˜Š

### HOW DEEP DOES IT GO?

A MSbuild "Target" groups tasks to be ran together at a certain build stage. 
You can reference MSB variables in these targets to do cool things like the "ReferenceCopyLocalPaths" var allows you
to gather the array of matched items and operate on it (in our case pack them into a single nuget for portability!)
